// This file has been replaced by MainTabView.swift
// Delete this file from your Xcode project to resolve build conflicts

/*
The original HomeTabView.swift has been replaced with MainTabView.swift
to resolve the "Multiple commands produce HomeTabView.stringsdata" error.

To fix the build issue:
1. In Xcode, select HomeTabView.swift in the Project Navigator
2. Right-click and choose "Delete"
3. Choose "Move to Trash" (not just "Remove Reference")
4. Clean Build Folder (Product â†’ Clean Build Folder)
5. Build the project

MainTabView.swift now contains the updated tab view implementation.
